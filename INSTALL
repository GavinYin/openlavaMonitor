Thanks for downloading openlavaMonitor.

To install it, make sure you have Python 3.5 or greater installed, you can 
also install Anaconda3-4.2.0 or greater version to solve packge dependencies. 
Then run this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py develop

If you're upgrading from a previous version, you'd better remove it first.
