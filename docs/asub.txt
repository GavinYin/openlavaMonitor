Tool "asub" is an wrapper of "bsub", it is used to set cpu/memory
reservation automatically on bsub setting based on history data.
The usage of "asub" is as below:

If there is no '-n SLOTS' or '-R "rusage[mem=MEM]"' setting on 
BSUB_OPTIONS, it will add the cpu/memory reservation setting

History data is from tool "batchRun.py", details please see
