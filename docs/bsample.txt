It is used to sample openlava data for job/queue/host/user.
The sampling jobs will be started with multi-thread if you specify more than one.
You can also start the tool as a serve process, then you must specify "-i INTERVAL"
to do the sampling work in a loop.


Suggest to start sampling job with crontab, below is an example.
